# Chapter 15: Arrays

At long last we introduce arrays!  These require more complex addressing math,
which in turn means we need to change how Loads and Stores do addressing - 
with true field *offsets* instead of field *names*.  This means we also 
will do a struct field *layout* in this chapter.

## Parser

The Parser changes to support arrays are fairly minimal.




## Type Array is TypeStruct



## New Address Math

## Struct Layout

## New Loads and Stores

## Some Simple Address Math Peeps
